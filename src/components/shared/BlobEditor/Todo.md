todo: on shift+enter... should manually insert the break entry after the current node in it's parent so that it does not trigger a full re-build of the parent node and it's content.

todo: on enter... should create the group node but without the break?

bug: multiple break chilren arent added to ner.children but are seen in entry.children.
